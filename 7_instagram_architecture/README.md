# Design Instagram services


## Use cases

- **User** views feeds 
- **User** makes posts
- **User** likes posts
- **User** comments on posts


### Non-functional assumptions

Due to Bard, Instagram has 500M daily active users and 95 million new posts are uploaded to Instagram every day. For simplicity, assume that image sige is ~500 Kb and video size is ~4Mb. And due to Bard, video takes 1/3 of daily new posts and images 2/3.
